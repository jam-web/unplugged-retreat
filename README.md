Responsive design demo

Based upon Skillcrush's Photoshop PSD, I created a fully responsive website for mobile, tablet, and desktop. The design includes working navigation pages. This is my second responsive design.
Rogue Pickings is the first and located in this repository.  I learned how to use breakpoints, media queries, and Chrome Developer Tools.
